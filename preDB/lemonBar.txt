Title: Keto Lemon Bar
Type: Dessert

Ingredients

½ cup unsalted butter (1 stick)
120 g almond meal (1 cup; I use TJ’s Almond Meal)
40 g powdered Erythritol (¼ cup; I use Swerve confectioners)
⅛ tsp vanilla extract
Pinch of salt

100 g almond flour (¾ cup; I use TJ’s blanched almond flour)
120 g powdered Erythritol (¾ cup)
3 oz. lemon juice (~3-4 medium lemons)
Zest of 1 lemon
3 large eggs
⅛ tsp almond extract
¼ tsp vanilla

Recipe

1. Preheat oven to 350° F.
2. Line an 8x8 in. glass baking dish with parchment paper.
3. In a medium bowl, mix all crust ingredients together until well incorporated.
4. Press crust mixture into dish until evenly coated. Bake in oven for 20 minutes, then let cool for 10 minutes.
5. While crust is baking, mix all filling ingredients together in a medium bowl. Once crust is done cooling, pour over crust.
6. Bake for 25-30 minutes. Filling should still have a slight jiggle in the center when done.
7. Let cool for 10 minutes on the counter, then place in the fridge until it’s finished setting.
