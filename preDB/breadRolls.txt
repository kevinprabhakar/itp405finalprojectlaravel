Title: Keto Bread Rolls
Type: Side Dish

Ingredients

1.25 cups almond flour
5 tablespoons ground psyllium husk powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon sea salt
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar
1.25 cups boiling water
3 egg whites

Recipe

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl.
2. Bring the water to a boil and add it, the vinegar and egg whites to the bowl, while beating with a hand mixer for about 30 seconds. Don’t over mix the dough, the consistency should resemble Play-Doh.
3. Moisten hands and form dough into 4 or 8 pieces of bread. You can also make hot dog or hamburger buns. Place on a greased baking sheet.
4. Bake on lower rack in oven for 50–60 minutes, depending on the size of your bread. They’re done when you hear a hollow sound when tapping the bottom of the bun.
5. Serve with butter and toppings of your choice. Store the bread in the fridge or freezer.
