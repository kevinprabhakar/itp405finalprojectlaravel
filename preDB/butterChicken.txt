Title: Keto Butter Chicken
Type: Main

Ingredients

1 lb chicken breast
1 cup Heavy Whipping Cream
2 tbsp Butter
1.5 tbsp tomato paste
2 cloves garlic
1/4 medium Onion
1.5 tsp turmeric
1 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp Pink Salt
3/4 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp Cinnamon

Recipe

1. Cut the chicken up into bite sized chunks and generously coat them in the turmeric, ginger, salt, chili powder and cinnamon. Set aside in a bowl.
2. Heat a skillet to medium heat and add the butter. As the butter melts dice the onion and garlic and add it to the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the onions are translucent and fragrant.
3. Increase the pan heat to medium-high and add the chicken. Cook it almost entirely through - the outside should be white and this will take about 3-5 minutes.
4.Once the chicken looks almost fully cooked add in the heavy whipping cream and tomato paste. Using a spatula mix in the tomato paste so it runs smooth through the heavy whipping cream. It should be an orange color at this point. Turn the heat to medium-low and cover with a lid for 5-7 minutes.
5. Remove lid and combine. The chicken is fully cooked and you should be able to eat it. However, if you like a thicker curry sauce allow it to reduce with the lid off until it reaches the consistency you like.
6. Serve with low carb naan or over cauliflower rice. Enjoy!
